## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Telegram-first admin interface (Kimmie already uses Telegram, hands dirty while grooming)
- Spicy Meter uses 1-3 peppers (Kimmie's existing mental model)
- No auto-post to social (approval required before anything goes public)
- Calendar sync is graceful - booking/reschedule/cancel succeed even if calendar API fails

### Completed Phases

**Phase 1: Calendar Sync** ✅
- 01-01: Added calendarEventId field to Appointment + updateCalendarEvent/deleteCalendarEvent functions
- 01-02: Wired calendarEventId storage on booking + reschedule/cancel endpoints

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~calendarEventId not stored on Appointment~~ ✅ FIXED in Phase 1
- ~~Booking creation not wrapped in transaction~~ Addressed via graceful error handling (calendar sync failures don't break bookings)
