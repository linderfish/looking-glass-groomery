## Feature Guide

### 1. Client & Pet Lookup (Your #1 Priority)

**Search by Name:**
```
Type: Sarah
Type: Sarah Johnson
Type: fluffy
Type: the corgi
```

Cheshire finds matching clients or pets and shows their full profile.

**Search by Phone:**
```
Type: 555-1234
Type: 951-555-0123
```

Cheshire finds the client with that phone and shows everything.

**Natural Language:**
```
"Who's that lady with the husky?"
"When did I last see Biscuit?"
"What's Luna's grooming style?"
"Does Max have any allergies?"
```

Cheshire understands conversational questions and looks up the answer.

**What You'll See:**

```

### 2. The Spicy Meter

Pet behavior rating you'll see prominently on profiles:

| Rating | Display | What It Means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | (one pepper) | Puppy bite, baby bite, not serious |
| 2 | (two peppers) | Serious bite, drawn blood, tried to injure |
| 3 | (three peppers) | Actively trying to eat you |

**Morning Briefing Warning:**
If today's appointments include spicy pets, you'll see a heads-up:
```
HEADS UP: 2pm Luna (3 peppers) - muzzle required
```

### 3. Voice Commands (Hands-Free!)

When your hands are covered in fur and soap, just hold the microphone button and speak:

**Works With Voice:**
- "Who's my next appointment?"
- "Look up the lady with the poodle"
- "How much did I make today?"
- "What's on my schedule tomorrow?"

Cheshire transcribes your voice, understands what you need, and sends back a text response you can glance at.

**Tips:**
- Speak clearly but naturally
- Background noise is OK
- Short sentences work best
- You'll get a text response (not voice back)

### 4. Photo Management

**Saving Groom Photos:**

1. Finish grooming the pet
2. Take your before/after photos
3. Send photos to Cheshire in Telegram
4. Cheshire asks: "Is this a Before or After photo?"
5. Tap the button to categorize
6. Photo saves to that pet's appointment record

**Photo Streak:**
Cheshire tracks how many consecutive days you've uploaded photos.
```
Photo streak: 7 days! Keep it going!
```

**End-of-Day Reminder:**
If it's evening and you haven't uploaded any photos that day:
```
Hey queen! You groomed 4 pets today but I don't have any photos saved.
